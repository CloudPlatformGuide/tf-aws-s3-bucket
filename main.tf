/**
 * # AWS Module Template
 * Additional information about the module, its purpose, and usage.
 * You can include details about the module's functionality, parameters, and any other relevant information.
 * This template serves as a starting point for creating AWS modules using Terraform.
 * Use markdown syntax for formatting, including headings, lists, and code blocks.
 * Then run `terraform-docs` to generate the documentation.
 * For example, you can use the following command:
 * ```bash
 * terraform-docs --config .config/.terraform-docs.yml .
 * ```
 * This will generate the documentation based on the text in this file, variables.tf, and outputs.tf and replace the content in README.md between the `<!-- BEGIN_TF_DOCS -->` and `<!-- END_TF_DOCS -->` tags.
 * Make sure to adjust the command and options according to your specific needs.
